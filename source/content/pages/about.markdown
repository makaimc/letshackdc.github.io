# About
There has been a surge of interest in tech startups during the past several 
years in the District. However, tech startups != software development, and we
care about great software development.

Great software development comes about by engaged developers with the freedom to
creatively solve problems using technology. Engaged developers attend events 
with their peers that get them excited about new programming techniques, 
languages and frameworks. These events should not be interfered with by 
recruiters, 
"[idea guys](http://signalvnoise.com/posts/2188-theres-no-room-for-the-idea-guy)"
and contracting firms looking to make a quick buck off developers working 
diligently to improve their craft.
