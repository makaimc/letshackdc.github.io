title: About Let's Hack DC
category: about
slug: about

There's recently been a surge of interest about startups throughout the 
District. However, startups != software development. We care about 
making software development better.

Great software development emerges from engaged hackers coding with 
freedom to creatively solve problems using technology. Engaged hackers 
attend events with their peers that get them excited about new programming 
techniques, languages and frameworks. These events should not be 
interfered with by recruiters, 
"[idea guys](http://signalvnoise.com/posts/2188-theres-no-room-for-the-idea-guy)"
or contracting firms looking to make a quick buck off developers who are 
diligently working to improve their craft.

Let's remember to avoid publicly disparaging event, organizations and people
that do not meet the [transparent criteria](/criteria.html) for
inclusion on this site. D.C. software developers should focus on improving our 
craft and community. Ignore the haters, if you will.

Do you know an event, company, or person that should be added to Let's Hack DC?
Is something or someone listed that no longer meets the criteria to be on this
site? Contact us or send a
